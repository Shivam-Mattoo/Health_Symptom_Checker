# Health Symptom Checker

A healthcare symptom analysis application that uses AI to provide educational information about possible conditions based on user symptoms. **This is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**

## Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: Input symptoms and receive AI-powered analysis of possible conditions
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Uses Pinecone vector database for context-aware responses
- **Query History**: Stores and retrieves previous symptom queries
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured FastAPI backend with OOP principles

## UI Implementation and Results

Below are screenshots of the Health Symptom Checker in action: input UI, progress state, result cards, severity/likelihood charts, and recommended actions.

### Fig 1 — User Information (Logged-in User)

</p>

*This screen shows the user entering symptoms in text format. After clicking **Analyze Symptoms**, the system begins processing the input using AI and displays a real-time progress indicator, informing the user that symptom analysis is underway.*

### Fig 4 — Severity Assessment and Symptom Summary

</p>

*This screen displays the symptoms reported by the user followed by an AI-generated **severity assessment**. The system categorizes the condition as Mild, Moderate, or Severe and provides an alert level percentage along with a brief explanation of what the severity rating means.*


### Fig 5 — Generated Possible Medical Conditions (Ranked by Likelihood )

<p align="center">

</p>

*This section displays the top potential medical conditions identified by the AI based on the user’s symptoms. Each condition is ranked and includes a likelihood percentage along with a short explanation. These results are educational suggestions only and not a medical diagnosis.*

### Fig 6 — Recommended Action Steps Based on Symptom Analysis

<p align="center">
  <img width="1919" height="1023" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 172335" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39d3cc67-9807-489b-a33d-43e92d3c41ec" />

</p>

*This section shows the AI-generated recommended action steps to help the user manage their symptoms. Each action is assigned a priority level, indicating its urgency and importance. The steps include explanations under “Why this matters” to help users understand the reasoning behind each recommendation.*

### Fig 7 — Visual Analytics & Charts for Condition Likelihood

<p align="center">

</p>

*This section provides visual insights through analytics charts. The **Likelihood Bar Chart** displays how strongly the user’s symptoms match each potential condition, while the **Pie Chart** shows the proportional distribution of these likelihoods. These visualizations help users quickly understand the analysis results at a glance.*

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Pinecone account
- Google Gemini API key

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to Backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create `.env` file** in the Backend directory:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri_here
   GEMINI_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
   PINECONE_API=your_pinecone_api_key_here
   PINECONE_INDEX=your_index_name

   ```

5. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend Setup

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file** in the Frontend directory (optional):

   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/symptoms/analyze`

}
```

**Response**:
```json

## Code Architecture

### Object-Oriented Design

The backend follows OOP principles with separate service classes:

- **DatabaseService**: Handles all MongoDB operations
- **LLMService**: Manages Gemini LLM interactions and response parsing
- **PineconeService**: Handles vector database operations for RAG

### Route Organization

Routes are organized in separate files within the `Routes/` folder:
- `symptom_routes.py`: All symptom-related endpoints

This keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.
